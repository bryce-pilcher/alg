/*
   This package provides various sorting algorithms.
   Each of these algorithms require a comparator function
   to be passed.

   The comparator function must take two values perform
   some comparison on them and return an integer and error.
   for values x,y:
	1: x < y
	0: x = y
       -1: x > y
